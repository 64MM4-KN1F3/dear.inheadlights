I am, and will continue to be a case for psychology. I have also benefited from talking-therapy, something that you might get from your GP if you're lucky, and you'll receive less and less the 'higher up' and more specialised the medical professional you see. This isn't the Proctologist's fault of course, it's the business around them that sees them as an 'investment' over time that needs to see a profitable return. It's the 'over time' bit that the layers of management, tracking software and other efficiency-bringers attempt to minimise so as to return that investment as quickly and as muchly as possible.

Where was I? Back to psychology, the fluffiest house-cat of the sciences; the companion animal of animals cursed by ~100 point IQs. What's the point?

Mummy will console you and give you a hug, whereas Daddy, who sits in the wooden-cheeked library in the evenings, distant, behind-closed-doors while he fondles his equally wooden pipe is hopefully thinking of how to fix something or things, or this or that and while physically distant, you know he might have a firm answer or solution, in-so-much that a hug is not a solution. So I think in this probably-sexist metaphore, mother is psychologist and father is proctologist (or some other specialist, short in time but capable and incisive-and-hopefully-not-probing)
