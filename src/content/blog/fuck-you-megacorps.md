The petty squabbling between megacorps like Apple and Google/Alphabet is painful and fucks consumers. There are arguments for walled gardens and associated closed-source mentalities - a control freak has better security in generally.. If I don't want to share my toys then that makes **my toys mine** and no-one elses. But fuck me, there are so many examples where this screws consumers.

In this case maybe you won't have a heap of sympathy. Aging tech bro can't do X with his Y, but I'm sure it's not just me..

I've been making excuses, any excuses for not exercising lately. This post is what I'm doing when I should be going for a jog in fact. Middle age, post-winter and I'm pretty sure I'm sitting somewhere between overweight and another label that starts with 'o' that I'd rather not write down.

Why not get off my arse? Well, I'd like to be able to listen to music while I run, and even though I've got a computer on my wrist with at least [hundreds](https://mrdansclasses.wordpress.com/2016/01/02/the-apple-watch-vs-the-entire-apollo-space-missions-or-moores-law-vs-human-achievement/), maybe a thousand times more processing power than the Apollo 11 Guidance Computer, in the context of Youtube Music on an Apple Watch, I can't simply listen to some downloaded songs/albums via my bluetooth headphone.

All of the technology is present. Bluetooth, storage, a fancy touch-screen interface. But because I stream music using Youtube Music and the watch is an Apple Watch, the squabbling between these two megacorps, who together have more money than numerous countries combined, means this is not possible.

Now, I'm sure there are far more horrendous examples of how jostling between these infantile megacorps results in actual, serious hardship for people and communities. But in this case, I just want one less excuse to get up off my arse and go for a jog.

Fuck you megacorps!
