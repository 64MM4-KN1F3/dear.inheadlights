The last time I started a blog was [about 25 years ago](http://ctrl.faithweb.com/index.htm). Let's see... What has changed since?

No, that's more words than I care to write for a 'first' post. Later maybe.. Let's instead start with what hasn't changed:
- I am still me
- The world continues
- Blogs are still a thing!

I'm looking forward to having a public scratch-pad again. Somewhere to howl, whimper or chirp into the void.

As a small preview, here are some ponderings I might bore the reader with:
- Music-related things
- LLM-related things
- Etymology/language-related things
- Tech-related things

It's good to be back.
