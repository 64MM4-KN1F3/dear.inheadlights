I am, and will continue to be, a case for Psychology. I have also benefited from talk-therapy, something that you get from your GP if you're lucky, and you'll receive less, and less of the 'higher up' and more specialised the medical professional you see. This isn't the Proctologist's fault of course, it's the business around him that sees them as an 'investment' over time that needs to see a profitable return. It's that 'over time' bit that the layers of management, tracking software and other efficiency-bringers attempt to minimise so as to return that investment as quickly and as muchly as possible.

Where was I? Back to psychology, the fluffiest house-cat of the sciences; the companion animal of those among us cursed by ~100 point IQs and health care. What's the point?

Mummy will console you and give you a hug, whereas Daddy, who sits in the wood-cheeked library in the evenings, distant, behind-closed-doors while he fondles his equally wooden pipe is hopefully thinking of how to fix something or things, or this or that and while physically distant from you, you know he might have a firm answer or solution, in-so-much that a hug is not a solution. In this probably-sexist metaphor, mother is Psychologist and father is Proctologist or Obstetrician specialising in respiritory conditions, Neurologist focussed on niche X, orthopedic surgeon focussed on niche Y.

In many, many cases I do think that the Beatles were right when they sung "All You Need is Hug". Many, many acute conditions will be alarming and painful but our bodies are so incredibly resiliant that in most cases, what we will benefit most from is the hug. Someone telling me "I can operate to clip off that bit of herniated disc between those vertebrae" *might* have a point, but in many cases the capital-managerial incentives for the surgeon makes me look like a nail to be hammered when may be what is needed is someone to tell me "your body is an amazing thing, you'll probably be okay if you keep fit and stay positive" and dangerous scalpels are avoided and healing is given some faith.
